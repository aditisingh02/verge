# Verge – Your Palette, Perfected

Verge isn’t just a color picker,it’s your creative partner for crafting color palettes that are beautiful, accessible, and informed by real color psychology.

## Why Color Theory Matters

**Instant Impact**: People react to color before reading a word. Within 15 seconds (often less), color is what grabs attention on a website.

### Practical Effects

- Eco-friendly brands use green for "nature" and calm.
- Food brands rely on reds and yellows to stimulate appetite.
- **Conversion Fact**: A/B tests show red call-to-action buttons can boost clicks by 21% compared to green - even if users report liking green more!

## What Makes Verge Special?

### 1. Intelligent, Playful Color Generation

- **Harmonious Palettes**: Pick one color and Verge applies classic color theory rules (analogous, complementary, triadic, split-complementary) instantly.
- **Live Previews**: See your colors applied to cards, buttons, and forms - not just hex codes.
- **Dark & Light Modes**: Instantly toggle between themes for real-world previews.
- **Educational Tooltips**: Not sure what “triadic” means? Verge teaches as you try.

### 2. Accessibility First

- **WCAG Compliance**: Real-time AAA/AA contrast validation.
- **Color Vision Support**: Simulate common types of color blindness.
- **Contrast Badges**: Verge flags unsafe combinations so you never exclude users unintentionally.

#### Example Contrast Ratings

| Combo              | Contrast Ratio | WCAG Badge |

| White on Dark Blue | 17.4:1         | AAA        |
| Primary on Surface | 7:1            | AAA        |
| Gray on Yellow     | –              | Fail       |

### 3. Real UI, Real Results

- **Applied Palettes**: Test your colors in realistic UI components (cards, forms, buttons).
- **Quick Exports**: Download or copy palettes as CSS Vars, Tailwind, JSON, or Figma Tokens.

### 4. Color Stories & Worldwide View

- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Global presets and insights help you avoid color missteps across cultures.

### 5. Friendly for All Levels
