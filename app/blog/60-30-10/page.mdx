# The 60-30-10 Rule & Using Color to Enhance Your Design

## What Is the 60-30-10 Rule?

The 60-30-10 rule is a timeless approach to building well-balanced, visually appealing color schemes in design - whether for interiors, branding, websites, or user interfaces.

> Think of it as a design recipe: 60% base, 30% support, 10% spice.

### The Formula

- **60%** – Dominant color  
  Sets the overall mood and forms the visual backdrop for your design.
- **30%** – Secondary color  
  A complementary or supporting shade that adds interest and depth.
- **10%** – Accent color  
  The pop! Use this hue to highlight key details and guide user action.

## Why Does the 60-30-10 Rule Matter?

- **Creates Visual Harmony**: Fixed percentages prevent chaos and imbalance.
- **Guides Attention**: The dominant shade grounds the viewer, the secondary adds contrast, and the accent draws focus to CTAs or interactive elements.
- **Simplifies Choices**: Reduces color overload and supports a clean, consistent look.

> A limited palette used intentionally is more powerful than a rainbow of random hues.

## How to Apply the Rule (with UI Examples)

### Step 1: Choose Your Palette

Pick three hues:

- A **neutral** for grounding
- A **supporting** color for structure
- A **statement** color for key actions

### Step 2: Assign Visual Roles

| Role      | Percentage | UI Usage                              |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Dominant  | 60%        | Backgrounds, primary surfaces         |
| Secondary | 30%        | Cards, nav, sidebars, large UI blocks |
| Accent    | 10%        | Buttons, links, icons, highlights     |

### Example UI Palette

- **60%** – White or light gray background
- **30%** – Deep blue cards or navigation
- **10%** – Bright orange buttons for “Add to Cart” or “Submit”

> This rule doesn’t restrict creativity - it gives it structure.

## Real Design Benefits

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Accents stand out naturally, driving interaction.
- **Consistency**: The UI looks cohesive across screens and components.
- **Accessibility**: Fewer colors make contrast testing and WCAG compliance easier.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Slight variations are fine, but stay near the 60-30-10 ratio.
- Let **accents shine**: Reserve bold hues for that 10% impact.
- **Don't overcrowd**: Too many colors = distraction and confusion.
- Apply this rule not only in UI design but also in branding, decks, and marketing assets.

> Minimal color + maximal purpose = professional design.

## Conclusion

The 60-30-10 rule is your shortcut to creating beautiful, professional, and functional color palettes - whether you’re designing a website, an app, or a brand.

> Let your primary color breathe. Support it with a secondary. Make it memorable with a purposeful accent.
